VERSE 1
[Tone: Nostalgic, storytelling with slight melancholy]
[Pace: Steady groove, conversational]
Remember when we used to kick it every single day
[Smile in the voice, reminiscing]
Same dreams, same block, didn't matter what they'd say
[Emphasis on "same", building connection]
You was right beside me when the world felt cold
[Warmer tone, appreciative]
Two young kids with hearts made of gold
[Melodic delivery on "gold"]
But seasons change and people grow apart
[Slight sadness, acceptance]
You found your calling, made a brand new start
[Lift tone, positive shift]
Heard you got a family now, got a steady job
[Genuine happiness for them]
Left the streets behind, man, you beat the odds
[Emphasis on "beat the odds", proud]
I remember when you said you wanted something more
[Reflective, looking back]
Now you got that white picket fence and the stable floor
[Paint the picture, detailed]
We don't talk as much but that don't mean I'm bitter
[Clear, honest delivery]
Different paths we took but you're still my day one, consider
[Strong emphasis on "day one", emotional weight]
Life ain't always go the way we planned it in our youth
[Philosophical, wise tone]
But I'm proud of where you at, and that's the honest truth
[Sincere, emphasize "honest truth"]

CHORUS
[Tone: Affirmative, uplifting, almost sung]
[Delivery: Melodic, smooth, could add slight harmony]
I ain't holdin' grudges, nah, I'm happy for you
[Warm, genuine - slight melodic rise]
Do what makes you whole, chase what makes it true
[Encouraging, supportive tone]
We all got our journey, ain't no right or wrong way
[Wisdom, acceptance]
Keep your head up high, I got love for you always
[Peak emotion, emphasize "love" and "always"]
(I got love for you)
[Echo/repeat with softer tone]
(Ain't no hard feelings)
[Reassuring]
(I got love for you)
[Fade slightly]
