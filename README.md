PERFORMANCE NOTES
This is a TAKEOVER - maximum aggression with Nigerian street credibility.
Key performance elements:

Confidence is EVERYTHING: Never sound uncertain
Pidgin is natural: Not translated, it's how you speak
Threats are real: Deliver with conviction
Swagger is inherent: You own every space
Nigerian pride: Represent with full chest
Energy never drops: Maintain intensity throughout

Vocal character: Street boss, untouchable, respected and feared. Mix of American hip-hop aggression with Nigerian street authority.
Code-switching: Seamless blend - English for universal appeal, Pidgin for authenticity and cultural pride. Never apologize for either.
Crowd engagement: This is meant to move people. Leave space for response. Command attention.
Critical Delivery Points

Never rush threats - let them sit
Punch the hook - make it memorable
Own the Pidgin - it's not accent, it's language
Build and release - create tension, then explode
End dominant - never fade weak

This is about POWER. Deliver accordingly.
